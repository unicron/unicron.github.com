What a weekend!  My inlaws were in town this past weekend and we ended up eating what felt like _constantly_.  Here is a summary of what I ate (yes this is just me).

1. Chipotle grilled cheese from [Big Cheese](http://bigcheesetruck.com/), chicken pot pie and apple crumb pie from [Dangerous Pies](http://dangerouspiesdc.com/) (Foggy Bottom)
1. Roasted Miso-glazed chilean sea bass and coconut cake at [Sea Pearl](http://www.seapearlrestaurant.com/) (Merrifield, VA)
1. Reuben sandwich and chili cheese fries from [Chick n Ruths](http://www.chickandruths.com/)  (Annapolis, MD)
1. Crab cake, crab dip, steamed shrimp, and hushpuppies from [Jimmy Cantlers](http://www.cantlers.com/) (Annapolis, MD)
1. Bacon flight, eggs benedict, and a doughnut at [Eola](http://eoladc.com/) (Dupont)
1. Burrata, polenta with crispy goat, pheasant ragu, spaghetti, pumpkin risotto, truffle, fontina, and duck egg pizza from [Graffiato](http://graffiatodc.com/) (Penn Quarter)
1. Scallion, sour cream, and bacon omelette at [Le Pain Quotidien](http://www.lepainquotidien.us/) (Dupont)

I know, I know... this is pretty worthless without pictures!  Well, honestly, I was too busy eating.  Maybe next time.  Seriously.
